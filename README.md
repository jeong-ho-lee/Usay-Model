# Usay
**Usay** is an AI Chatbot for developers who are preparing for tech interviews in the Computer Science field.  
**Usay** evaluates the user's interview performance and provides feedback to help them better articulate Computer Science concepts in an interview setting.
# Features
Once the interview begins, **Usay** presents a question on a Computer Science field for the user to answer. After the user submits their answer, **Usay** provides a **score**, a **detailed explanation** for that **score**, and **actionable tips** on how to improve.

# How to use it
Since the server is not currently active, you will need to run the inference process on your local machine.  
1. **Prerequisite** : Before you begin, make sure you have a **Hugging Face Token**.  
2. **Execution** : Run the shell commands sequentially up to the fourth shell within the Inference chapter. This will generate an interview question.
3. **Answering** : Once the question is displayed, enter your answer in the next cell by assigning it to the user_answer variable:
```python
user_answer = "Your answer here."
```
4. **Evaluation:** Execute that cell to receive your **score** and **detailed feedback**.
