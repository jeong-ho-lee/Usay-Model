Usay is an AI Chatbot for developers who are preparing for tech interviews in the Computer Science field.  
Usay evaluates the user's interview performance and provides feedback to help them better articulate Computer Science concepts in an interview setting.

# How to use it
Because the server is not running right now, you need to run it local on your computer. For this, first you need a **Hugging Face Token**. After that you can just run the shells step by step to the 4th shell of **Inference** chapter. When generating question are finished, you should write down your answer on the very next shell in
```python
user_answer = "Here"
```
and if you run it, you will get the **Score** and **Feedback**.
